	<p>Dear visitor,</p>

	<p>
		Nomdial is a platform to discover and learn more about international cuisine. It is
		community-driven, all information is supplied by visitors like you!
	</p>

	<p>
		The idea for this project originates in <a
			href="https://www.grotepodcastlas.nl/"
			target="_blank">"De Grote Podcastlas"</a
		>, a Dutch podcast. Each episode covers one country in the world, including the country's
		history, politics, culture (including food!) and sports. It is the audio-version of an atlas. A
		highly recommended listen if you understand Dutch and like learning about the world. In one of
		the episodes, the hosts uttered that it would be nice to have a way to find cool restaurants,
		for example of Malagasi food. Well, here it is!
	</p>

	<p>
		I built this platform as a way to share my passion for food and to also learn more about it
		myself. This is something I built on the side, just for fun. If you are interested in the code,
		it is available publicly on <a href="https://github.com/leekeh/nomdial" target="_blank"
			>Github</a
		>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I had some fun making the design for this site. I tried to make something that is playful and
		maybe different from most websites you may visit. I hope nonetheless that it is pleasing to the
		eyes. I care a lot about accessibility and tried to take different users into account while
		creating Nomdial. However, if there is an issue with the usability, please do let me know via
		the contact form below.
	</p>

	<p>The following resources were used to create this site:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Fonts: a, b,c , d</li>
		<li>Icons: aa</li>
		<li>Backgrounds: etc</li>
	</ul>
